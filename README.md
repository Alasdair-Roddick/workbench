## Contributing

### GitHub Projects

All branches must be made via github projects. This is to ensure a steady flow of tasks that need to be done

### Committing

Before committing any project please make sure that:

It is neat and tidy: `npm run format`
It passes linting: `npm run lint`
The project builds: `npm run build`

If both of these pass, then the merge can be done
